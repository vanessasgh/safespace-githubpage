# Delivery Plan
## What will the project management practices be?
The PM will be responsible for creating GitHub Issues and assigning them to individuals at the start of every week. These issues will be under a milestone in which the whole team will be tasked to complete before a given deadline. It is expected that some milestones will be due by the same deadline, so team members will have to work on the assigned tasks simultaneously. We will asynchronously communicate through our Discord group chat in order to coordinate shared work (if a team member finishes their tasks) and address any confusions swiftly.

## Will you have meetings? How frequently? Who plans their agendas?
Aside from the time that we meet in classes on Mondays and Wednesdays, we plan to meet at least twice a week: one meeting to assign and understand tasks and one meeting to review and revise completed work. During our meetings outside of class, we will work together to generate all the tasks that need to be completed so that the entire team is aware of how all the components come together, but ultimately, the PM will be planning each individualâ€™s weekly agendas based on skill set and schedules. If one team member finishes early, we may have them assist someone who has not finished their tasks.
